==== even newer stuff (this needs to be pruned!) ====
- admin UI (pw-protected?!)
- allow admin to upload CSV (instead of requiring server command line access)
- put pilot information into actual database (instead of reading from CSV)
- save pilot status in actual database (so can restart bb without losing all the current context)
- mapping of drivers and pilots
- pilot-assigned status "overlay" (not the same as the regular status)
- documentation directly accessible in system (at least for Admin)
- links to instructions for pilots (could still be the google docs)
- link to google sheet for submitting tracking system details
- add SSL

==== newer stuff ====
- /logs isn't working?! (what happened?)
- support splitting out into different pages depending on which event (Race, Sprint, Clinic)
- abstract the pilot record fields from the csv column headers
- create an actual pilot object and stop being lazy
- rename status directory to archive/status-<timestamp>
- make initial pilot log files in status directory
- update pilot status from last message in status file director
- move all the HTML out into a template
- make index.html a true template and incorporate the nav_bar rendering system

- check that handle_reset_confirm is being done the "right" way

- "NOT" split into
-- "NOT" = known to not be flying today
-- "" (blank) = reset to start the day

- NEW status options
-- LMB ("Landed per Mary Beth"): bright yellow, so not LOK, but still known to be safe
-- SMB ("See Mary Beth"): orange, so not FLY, but did not go properly and needs education
- Probably should change to more generic codes, for example
-- LMB -> LFX (Landed, but LOK message needs to be fixed)
-- SMB -> ERR (Inproper messages, see Retrieve Coordinator or Organizer)

- SPOT MESSAGE PARSING ISSUES (still?!)
*** Need email parser for international SPOTs (sending email with extra preamble info to SMS recipient since don't have proper "@vtext.com" style phone recipients)
[workaround-ish: put pilot number (#000) into username so that BB at least SHOWS it]

- separate status channel for driver assignment info (show up in listview? or driverview?)

x Convert incoming status message to upper (gt needs to check: this might be fixed)

- review the log file to confirm it has all pertainent message processing details
-- confirm log date stamps in local time zone

- extract lat/lon from parsable messages (look for 'll='' and '(4[12]\.' and ...?)

- convert lat/lon to clickable map link

- embed map on pilotview page (with pin on last known pilot location)
*** - embed map on listview page showing last known location of all "LOK" pilots

X Auto-update (reload) Overview page

- Warm restart (renew latest status message, use /refresh and have another verify step)

- organizer view (hidden/pw protected from public)
-- direct access to "Logs" view
-- direct access to /reset
-- direct access to /refresh

X /pilotview/### (direct access for a pilot to their own status and messages received)
X also accessible as /pilot/###

- Update "acknowledge" message to be more specific. For example "Received #172 LOK"

- Check that the # of connections is sufficient (all pilots checking their status)


==== PREVIOUS TO DO ITEMS ====
- require authentication for debug and complete pilot details
X check for sample SPOT message
X turn on/configure new phone number
- update views
  - overview page
    X get the color key working again
    X get number to pop
    X show sample of all statuses
  - single pilot page
    - simple URL bowerbird.meteor.com/7
    X show message/status history, most current first
- SPOT stuff
  - got an LOK from a SPOT, send ACK to associated cell phone
- retrieve handling
  - assign retrieve driver:
    - GT sends 7 RZA to Twillio/bowerbird
      - bowerbird sends pilot a driver assignment
      - bowerbird sends driver a pilot and location
    * can i send a message to multiple recipients?
- robustify message parsing
  X parse SPOT messages
  X parse DeLorme messages
  X handle leading spaces
  X parse lat/lon out of DeLorme messages
  X parse lat/lon out of SPOT messages
  - add feedback for invalid pilot number
