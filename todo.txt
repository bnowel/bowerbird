# Bowerbird To Do Items and Wish List
*** is next priority to do

## NEWEST ITEMS (not yet categorized)
- reset should clear json
- Retrieve view not showing driver status
- Driver view not showing status status
- Update driver view with new columns
- Fix driver view color coding
- auto refresh for enchilada, etc.
- fix pilot detail view (cleaner super like std)


- support lower case driver codes
- driver status messages (in/out)

## Webpage items
***- Make index.html a true template and incorporate the nav_bar rendering system
- Password protected area (for Admin: provide links to admin commands, such as reset)
***- More structured navigation (separate Pilot information from Manage/Admin information)
x Documentation directly accessible in Bowerbird (at least for Admin) [done 20190604]
x Links to instructions for pilots (could still be the google docs) [done 20190604]
x Link to google sheet for submitting tracking system details [done 20190604, in the google doc]
- Add SSL
- Require authentication for debugging and showing complete pilot details
- Organizer (Manage/Admin) view (hidden/pw protected from public)
-- direct access to "Logs" 
-- direct access to /reset
-- direct access to /refresh
- Move all the HTML out into a template
- Separate status channel for driver assignment info (show up in listview? or driverview?)
- Add brief descriptions (mini-documentation) to Error and Logs pages (explain what to look for)
- Overview for pilots with different status as Overview for Manage (still not same as Retrieve board)

## Web interface items
- Allow admin to upload pilot and driver CSV directly (instead of requiring command line access)
***- Split into different pages depending on which event (Race, Sprint, Clinic) [alternative: separate tables on same Overview page]
- Warm restart (renew latest status message, use /refresh and have another verify step)

## Structural items
x Put pilot information into actual database (instead of reading from CSV) [done 20190604]
x Save pilot status so can restart bb without losing all the current context [done 20190604]
- Verify database is "live" after reload

## Retrieve support items
***- Track drivers
***- Associate drivers with pilots
***- Overview of pilot grid showing the drivers assigned (not the pilot status, such as LOK)
***- List of drivers with the pilots who are currently assigned to them (only those still who are "LOK", not "PUP")
- Embed map on pilotview page (with pin on last known pilot location)
- Embed map on listview page showing last known location of all "LOK" pilots (AND Drivers!)
- Advanced automated retrieve handling (assigning retrieve driver):
    - Retrieve coordinator sends #127 DRA to Bowerbird
      - Bowerbird sends driver DRA a pilot (#127) and location (the lat/long from #127 LOK)
      - Bowerbird sends pilot #127 a driver assignment (optional)
***- Convert lat/lon to clickable Google map link in pilotview 
      
## Management support items
- Explicit message for unknown pilot number (currently just shows generic "ERROR")
- "WARNING" in Error log if name in message does not match pilot name in database
- List view with sortable headers (number, name, status)

## Admin support items
- Complete abstraction of the pilot record fields from the csv column headers (currently has some assumptions)
***- Rename status directory to archive/status-<timestamp>
***- Reset needs to backup log files to archive/status and then zero out current version (it also has to backup status files - that may have been broken in db conversion)
- Check that handle_reset_confirm is being done the "right" way
***- Review the log file to confirm it has all pertainent message processing details (was broken with Driver db addition)
***- Add command to check pilot_list.csv and add any new pilot numbers (differs from complete "reset" which clears all data and loads completely from pilot_list). Question: should it reload information for known pilot numbers?

## Pilot support items
- SPOT MESSAGE PARSING ISSUES (check each year)
-- Need email parser for international SPOTs (sending email with extra preamble info to SMS recipient since don't have proper "@vtext.com" style phone recipients)
[workaround-ish: put pilot number (#000) into username so that BB at least SHOWS it]
- Receive an LOK from a SPOT, send ACK to associated cell phone (instead of back to SPOT cell forwarder)
- Update "acknowledge" message to be more specific. For example "Received #172 LOK"
- NEW status options
-- LMB ("Landed per Mary Beth"): bright yellow, so not LOK, but still known to be safe
-- SMB ("See Mary Beth"): orange, so not FLY, but did not go properly and needs education
- Probably should change to more generic codes, for example
-- LMB -> LFX (Landed, but LOK message needs to be fixed)
-- SMB -> ERR (Inproper messages, see Retrieve Coordinator or Organizer)
- Extract lat/lon from parsable messages (look for 'll='' and '(4[12]\.' and ...?)

==== PREVIOUS TO DO ITEMS ====
X confirm log date stamps in local time zone

X also accessible as /pilot/###
